I developed a weather application utilizing modern JavaScript (ES6). This includes the use of features such as arrow functions, template literals, and promises for asynchronous operations, making the code more concise and readable. The app fetches real-time weather data from an external API, processes it, and displays it in a user-friendly interface.The application also leverages modern CSS for responsive design, ensuring optimal usability across different devices.
